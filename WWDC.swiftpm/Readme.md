# Space Cruiser - WWDC Scholarship Application 

The Swift Playgound App was created for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/swift-student-challenge/">WWDDC23 Swift Student Challenge</a>

## Introduction
This playground is an **accepted** submission for the WWDC18 Scholarship and features a game where you control a player with four different abilities that allow it to manipulate smaller entities, called Orbs. The objective is to survive through the waves of enemies before ultimately defeating The Boss. To achieve this, you will have to collect Power-Ups and decide correctly when to use your orbs for attack or defence.

## Project

In Jungle Rescue, the player's objective is to eliminate the pollutants before they fall into the forest. However, the player must be careful not to eliminate the non-polluting objects.

This app was built with SwiftUI and SpriteKIT (Two frameworks that a I've never used before👨🏻‍💻)

## How to play

Download the code project and open the app in Xcode. After that, press the play button and have fun! 🌱
