    let aboutEarth: String = "Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface."
    let earthSurface: String = "Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered in water, while the remaining is composed of land. The land masses are composed of a variety of landscapes, from mountains and deserts to forests and plains."
    let earthStructure: String = "Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle, and crust. The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles in radius. There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit."
    let earthCuriosity: String = "The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses."

    let aboutMoon: String = "The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth"
    let moonSurface: String = "The Moon's surface is covered in a layer of fine dust and rocky material which was created by the impact of meteorites and other celestial bodies over billions of years. The surface features include craters, mountains, and valleys, formed by these impacts and other geological processes."
    let moonStructure: String = "Earth's Moon has a core, mantle, and crust. The Moon’s core is proportionally smaller than other terrestrial bodies' cores. It is surrounded by a liquid iron shell 56 miles thick and a partially molten layer with a thickness of 93 miles surrounds the iron core."
    let moonCuriosity: String = "Earth's only natural satellite is simply called 'the Moon' because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610."
